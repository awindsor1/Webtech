<h2> About Me </h2> <a name= "About Me">
<p> <img src="images/Allison_Windsor.jpg" alt="Oops, I'm not here!" title="Allison's Lacrosse Headshot" width="100"/> I chose <a href="http://www.babson.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Babson College</a> because I have a passion for business. I took a few business classes in high school and realized I wanted to dig deeper into every aspect of a business. Having a well- rounded education where I could also play sports was also important to me. When I graduate, I plan to work in New York City as an analyst for Ross Stores. I wanted a job where i could use both my knowledge of fashion and numbers to make a difference within a company</p>

<h2> My Interests </h2> <a name= "My Interests">
<p> My biggest interest is <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/sports/lacrosse-women/d3">Lacrosse</a>. I play on the women's team here at Babson. We spend around 20 hours a week practicing from January until the end of April. Although it is time consuming, I love playing the game with my teammates.</p>
