   <p> I chose Babson because I have a passion for business. I took a few business classes in high school and realized I wanted to dig deeper into every aspect of a business. I wanted a well rounded education where I could also play sports. When I graduate, I want to work in consulting where I can make real decisions for companies. </p>

<p> My favorite sport is Lacrosse. I play here at Babson. I have been playing since I was 13. I play defense and I like how mental the position is and that it isn't based on speed. Although lacrosse is not a popular favorite sport, it is my passion. The game combines many aspects of other sports such as basketball and soccer. Although there is no professional league, I still enjoy watching lacrosse games over any other sport. </p>
