<h2> About Me </h2> <a name= "About Me">
<p> <img src="images/Allison_Windsor.jpg" alt="Oops, I'm not here!" title="Allison's Lacrosse Headshot"/>I chose <a href="http://www.babson.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Babson College</a> because I have a passion for business. I took a few business classes in high school and realized I wanted to dig deeper into every aspect of a business. Having a well-rounded education where I could also play sports was also important to me. I wanted a school where I could play lacrosse and have an academically chanllenging workload and Babson is the perfect place for that. When I graduate, I plan to work in New York City as an analyst for Ross Stores. As a Finance and Business Analytics major, I wanted a job function that was mathematically focused. I interned at Ross Stores this summer and was very happy with the company and my experience as a whole. The interns were an important part of the company and they treated us like we were full time employees. Ross has many career advancement opportunities which was important to me. I wanted a job where i could use both my knowledge of fashion and numbers to make a difference within a company. I knew that I wanted to work outside of Boston, and New York is my dream city to live in. I'm excited to start my career there. </p> <br/>

<h2> My Interests </h2> <a name= "My Interests">
<p> My biggest interest is <a href="http://www.uslacrosse.org/">Lacrosse</a>. I play on the women's team here at Babson. We spend around 20 hours a week practicing from January until the end of April. Although it is time consuming, I love playing the game with my teammates.</p>
