        <h1> Allison's Project Proposal </h1>
<hr/>

<h2> What is my Website About? </h2>
<p> My website will be about Stuart, Florida. It is a small, quaint town on the east coast of Florida. As my hometown, I want people to be able to have a better understanding of what this town has to offer. </p>

</hr>

<h2> What is the Objective of my Website? </h2>
<p> The objective of my website will be to inform people of an unknown vacation destination. I will explain the history of the town as well as include attractions and things to do in the area. </p>

<hr/>

<h2> Who is my Target Audience? </h2>
<p> My target audience is either people who want to vacation in Stuart, or people who want to be informed about a great town that little is known about. </p>

<hr/>

<h2> What content do I plan to include in each page of my website? </h2>
<p> <ul>
<li> <i>Home page</i>: an overview of the location of the town and highlights of what is available to do that will link back to each page</li>
<li> <i>History</i>: a page dedicated to the history of the town and its origins </li>
<li> <i>Attractions</i>: give details about what is available to do in Stuart and popular activities </li>
<li> <i>Dining</i>: the best restaurants and a brief synopsis of the atmosphere </li>
<li> <i>Rentals</i>: Links to the best hotels and rentals in the area and an explanation of which is best for various types of travelers </li>
</ul>
